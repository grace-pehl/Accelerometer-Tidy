Project for Getting and Cleaning Data course of Johns Hopkins data science specialization.\r\n\r\n# Study Design\r\n\r\nThe raw dataset was taken from Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012.\r\n\r\n## Collection of the Raw Data\r\n\r\nA complete description of the experimental design is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).\r\n\r\n30 volunteeres aged 19-48 performed 6 activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. Linear acceleration and angular velocity were measured by the phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.\r\n\r\n## Notes on the Raw Data\r\n\r\nData was collected at a constant rate of 50 Hz along three axes (XYZ). Data was subsequently filtered and separated as described for each variable. All measurements were then normalized to zero with bounds -1, 1.\r\n\r\n# Creating the Tidy Datafile\r\n\r\n## Guide to Create the Tidy Data File\r\n\r\nDownload the analysis script run_analysis.R from GitHub into your working directory and run the script in R.\r\nThe script will check if the raw data zip file is present in the directory and download it if necessary.\r\nIf \"/UCI HAR Dataset\" is not present, the script will unzip the raw data file\r\nThe script will merge the training and test data with subject identifiers, activity labels, and measurement variable names.\r\nThe average of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement will be output for each activity and subject.\r\nThe output is written to \"SamsungData_tidy.txt\" using write.table with row.names = FALSE.\r\nCleaning of the data\r\n\r\nEach activity was perfomed by all subjects multiple times and accelerometer and gyroscope readings were collected. The normalized mean and standard deviation were calculted for each variable and recorded for each observation. These means and standard deviations are averaged by the cleaning script to create one pair of values for each measurement per activity and subject.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
